## Retrospective
Made for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123053111/https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-204" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weekly Game Jam 204</a>.


### The Idea
The jam theme was &ldquo;downhill&rdquo;.

I juggled several ideas this week, but crypto’s volatility kept repeating on me. I had observed the events that lead up to the most recent dip. The memes and discussion threads that followed too. So I thought that for this week it would be fun to explore and communicate aspects of it.


### What went well
I learned a ton this week and I hope it shows in the presentation and interactivity.

One of the criticisms I received last week was that the game was too short. So this week, I’ve explored a game with several endings.

When the jam wrapped up, I had enough time between to be able to go back and fix up issues in the previous week&apos;s project.


### What went wrong
I wasted a LOT of time trying to figure out how to render a line graph. If I had asked somebody in Discord, then I could’ve saved myself the better part of a day. In the end, I cut the feature.

I also spent much too long trying to figure out how to make sprites respond to click events. No amount of prior CSS z-index knowledge helped. Several wasted hours later, I realised that I could’ve used Unity’s built-in UI buttons. So I implemented those instead.


### What I learned
When you’re stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes, ask somebody.
