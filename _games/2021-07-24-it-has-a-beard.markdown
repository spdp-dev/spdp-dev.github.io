## Retrospective
Made for <a href="https://onehourgamejam.com/?page=jam&jam=326" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Hour Game Jam</a> with the theme "Virtual Pet".


#### About The Game
It's a "clean-em-up".

Cyber pets require you to periodically clean the screen. So this is what came to mind when the theme was announced.

To play you simply need to collide with the poops that spawn.


#### Jamming In One Hour
It was my second time participating in this jam.

When comparing this to the last submission, you can see my one hour prototyping ability has improved.

The game features a little narrative, a little more gameplay and two possible outcomes. I'm pleased with it given the time limit. It got a laugh on the Twitch stream too!
