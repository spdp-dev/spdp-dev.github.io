## About The Game

A throwback 3D platforming project with elements inspired by the classics.

Made in 16 weeks as a major project on Mastered's real-time 3D skills bootcamp.

### Features:

- 3D platforming inspired by '90s character action platformers.
- An in-game journal system, revealing pages as puzzle pieces are collected.
- A variety of levels evoking 3D platforming tropes
- Challenge areas which progressively increase in difficulty.
