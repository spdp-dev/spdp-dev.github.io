Made for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/norwich-games-festival-jam-2024" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Norwich Games Festival Jam 2024</a> with the theme "beyond the stars".

Unfortunately, I failed to complete this within the jam timeframe, but I've achieved enough with it that I hope to take it forward as a side project.

It's planned to be a Metroidvania of sorts, or a "Microvania," as I called it during ideation. Your ship, "The Magdalen," has crash-landed on a nearby planet, and you must search the environment for parts to repair it. Bring those parts back to the ship, radio your friends, and make your way back home!

A full retrospective will be written once I release it with the scope intended for the jam.
