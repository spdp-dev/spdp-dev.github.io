This iteration of spdp.dev features a simplified portfolio presentation, simplified project pages, and a much improved blog format which now includes syntax highlighting. It's all based on more reliable foundations thanks to the use of Jekyll's Minima theme, with really only minor template and CSS overrides on my part.

A basic structure is now in place. Some pages however will remain <em>"Under Construction"</em> until I port old assets across. Some of these I am recapturing and editing down to a more suitable scale, which all takes time.

So that I don't get lost in the weeds of portfolio maintenance again, I intend to queue issues in a Kanban and address them in Sunday sprints. Tending to the portfolio on occasion much like one would tend to their garden. A recreational side hobby, and not the thing which dominates my attention.
