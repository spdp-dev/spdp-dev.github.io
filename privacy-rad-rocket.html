		<p>Rad Rocket - Privacy Policy

		<p>"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" or so the saying goes...

		<p>I care about privacy. So much so infact that I have zero interest in collecting data in any game that I release in a personal capacity. As such, Rad Rocket does not ask for any device permissions and there are no cookies, trackers or forms with which you might submit information.

		<p>Rad Rocket was developed in the GameMaker Studio 2 game engine and it is offered for free with no in-app purchases or other means of monetisation. Every effort has been made to ensure that analytics and bug reporting features have been disabled prior to building.

		<p>I offer a public email address voluntarily on the app listing with the purpose of receiving Rad Rocket-related queries. By sending email to this address, you volunteer your own email address and any other information included in the email you send.

		<p>There are no clickable links to external websites within the app.

		<p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please reach out to me at hello@spdp.dev.
